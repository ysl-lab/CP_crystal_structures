# Cyclic peptide crystal structures

This repository contains the crystal structure data of 52 cyclic peptide structures as reported in "A backbone-dependent rotamer library with high (φ,ψ) coverage using metadynamics simulations"

Cyclic peptides were curated from collections of cyclic peptides reported in the following papers:
- Huang H, Damjanovic J, Miao J, Lin Y-S (2021) Cyclic peptides: backbone rigidification and capability of mimicking motifs at protein–protein interfaces. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23:607–616.
- Malde AK, Hill TA, Iyer A, Fairlie DP (2019) Crystal structures of protein-bound cyclic peptides. Chem. Rev. 119:9861–9914.
- Prasad VK, Otero-de-la-Roza A, DiLabio GA (2019) PEPCONF, a diverse data set of peptide conformational energies. Sci. Data 6:180310.

Structures were obtained from the Protein Databank and Cambridge Structureal Database Files are formated as PDB files. A list of all structure codes, strutural dataase, sequence and length can be found in pbd_data.csv

Files are provided as-is with no guarentee of accuracy. If using this database, please cite the following:
